# Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenge - Mobile Security

## Overview
Welcome to the Mobile Security CTF Challenge! This competition is designed to test your skills in mobile application security by identifying and exploiting various vulnerabilities. The challenges cover common security flaws found in mobile applications, including hardcoded secrets, insecure storage, XSS, and more.

### üìå Challenges Overview
This CTF consists of **eight** challenges, each designed to simulate real-world security issues. Your goal is to analyze the application, identify vulnerabilities, and exploit them to retrieve the flag.

## üî• Challenges & Descriptions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Hardcoded Secrets
- **Description**: Sensitive data such as API keys, credentials, and access tokens are hardcoded into the application.
- **Related Code**: `AESUtils` (hardcoded `SECRET_KEY` and `SALT` in encryption logic)
- **Goal**: Decompile the APK and extract the secrets.
- **Tools**: APKTool, jadx, strings, grep

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Insecure Storage
- **Description**: The application improperly stores sensitive user data in shared preferences or unprotected databases.
- **Related Code**: `InSecureDB`, `StorageHelper`, `RetrieveDB` (unencrypted flag storage, SQL injection vulnerabilities)
- **Goal**: Locate and extract stored sensitive information.
- **Tools**: ADB, SQLite, Frida

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Description**: The application fails to properly sanitize user inputs, allowing JavaScript execution.
- **Related Code**: `DashboardActivity` (user input processing)
- **Goal**: Inject malicious JavaScript code and execute it.
- **Tools**: Burp Suite, JavaScript payloads

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Deep Links Exploitation
- **Description**: The application exposes deep links that can be manipulated to access restricted content or execute unintended actions.
- **Related Code**: `DeeplinkHandlerActivity` (processes deep link requests)
- **Goal**: Identify and exploit deep link vulnerabilities.
- **Tools**: ADB, Drozer, Logcat

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Vulnerable IPC Components
- **Description**: Insecure inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms allow unauthorized access to app functionalities.
- **Related Code**: `VulnerableServiceActivity`, `MyObserver`, `MyService` (monitors file updates, background processes)
- **Goal**: Exploit weak IPC security to execute privileged actions.
- **Tools**: Drozer, ADB, Frida

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Steganography
- **Description**: Hidden messages or flags are embedded in images or media files within the application.
- **Related Code**: `FightActivity`, `StegnoActivity` (extracts hidden data from images)
- **Goal**: Extract the hidden flag using steganographic analysis.
- **Tools**: Stegsolve, zsteg, binwalk

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Smali Code Manipulation
- **Description**: The application can be reverse-engineered and modified using Smali to bypass certain restrictions.
- **Related Code**: `MainActivity2`, `SecretManager` (uses Java Reflection, native code obfuscation)
- **Goal**: Decompile, modify, and recompile the Smali code to obtain the flag.
- **Tools**: APKTool, Smali, jadx

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Root & Debugger Detection (Frida Bypass)
- **Description**: The app contains root and debugger detection mechanisms that prevent analysis.
- **Related Code**: `NextActivity`, `SecurityUtils` (implements root detection, anti-debugging techniques)
- **Goal**: Bypass the detection using Frida or other dynamic instrumentation tools.
- **Tools**: Frida, Magisk, Xposed
